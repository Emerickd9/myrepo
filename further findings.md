Findings
It appears that gun related homicides in the US disproportionately affect people in the Black and Hispanic racial categories.

Some areas to investigate further:

The link between month and homicide rate.
Homicide rate by gender.
The rates of other intents by gender and race.
Gun death rates by location and education.
